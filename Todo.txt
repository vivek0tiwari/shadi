groom -- An open minded cool calm and practical person with a positive attitude.
bride-- A simple and fun loving girl with both modern and traditional beliefs.

she loves him more than he'll ever know and he loves her more than he'll ever show.

we come to love not by finding a perfect person learning to 
see an imperfect person perfectly.

you have me until every last star in the galaxy dies, you have me.

I love you thats the begining and end of  everything

The world seems somehow much quitter when you are next to me 
as though my senses cannot focus on anything  but you.

you are my today and all my tommorrows.

he's more myself than i am whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same.
